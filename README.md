# Weather React Application (2017)

A simple react application that uses the OpenWeatherMap.com API to display the weather of a given city. 
This project was completed as a part of the [Complete React Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/learn/v4/overview) by Andrew Mead. It includes playing with *Axios, JavaScript Destructuring, Arrow Functions, JSX, Babel, Reusable React Components, SCSS with Foundation,* and *Promises*, among others. A live version of this application is deployed in Heroku, [here.](https://protected-crag-49946.herokuapp.com/)

To deploy locally, simple run `webpack` to install dependencies and deploy the server using `node server.js`. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
